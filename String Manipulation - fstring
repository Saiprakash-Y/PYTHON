# Write a function called greet that takes two arguments: name (a string) and age (an integer).
# The function should return a string message in the format "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."

def greet(name: str, age: int):
# An f-string (short for formatted string literal) is a way to embed expressions inside string literals,
# using curly braces {}. It was introduced in Python 3.6 and makes string formatting simpler and more readable.
# The f before the string tells Python to evaluate expressions inside {}.
# You can put variables, math, or even function calls inside the curly braces.
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
print(greet("Jim", 20))

message = greet("jim", 20)
print(message)

# Here's how you can make the greet function interactive using user input:

def greet(name, age):
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# Get user input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Call the function and print the result
message = greet(user_name, user_age)
print(message)

# Math inside f-strings:

x = 5
y = 3
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}")

# Function calls:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hi, {name}!"

print(f"{greet('Priya')} Welcome to the course.")

# Formatting numbers:

pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
